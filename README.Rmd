# rmapshaper

An R package providing access to the awesome [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/) tool by Matthew Bloch, which has both a [Node.js command-line tool](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Introduction-to-the-Command-Line-Tool) as well as an [interactive web tool](https://mapshaper.org/).

I started this package so that I could use mapshaper's [Visvalingam](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/) simplification method in R. There is, as far as I know, no other R package that performs topologically-aware multi-polygon simplification. (This means that shared boundaries between adjacent polygons are always kept intact, with no gaps or overlaps, even at high levels of simplification).

But mapshaper does much more than simplification, so I am working on wrapping most of the core functionality of mapshaper into R functions.

So far, `rmapshaper` provides the following functions:

- `ms_simplify` - simplify polygons or lines
- `ms_clip` - clip an area out of a layer using a polygon layer or a bounding box. Works on polygons, lines, and points
- `ms_erase` - erase an area from a layer using a polygon layer or a bounding box. Works on polygons, lines, and points
- `ms_dissolve` - aggregate polygon features, optionally specifying a field to aggregate on. If no field is specified, will merge all polygons into one.
- `ms_explode` - convert multipart shapes to single part. Works with polygons, lines, and points in geojson format, but currently only with polygons and lines in the `Spatial` classes (not `SpatialMultiPoints` and `SpatialMultiPointsDataFrame`).
- `ms_lines` - convert polygons to topological boundaries (lines)
- `ms_innerlines` - convert polygons to shared inner boundaries (lines)
- `ms_points` - create points from a polygon layer
- `ms_filter_fields` - Remove fields from the attributes
- `ms_filter_islands` - Remove small detached polygons

If you run into any bugs or have any feature requests, please file an [issue](https://github.com/ateucher/rmapshaper/issues/)

### Installation

`rmapshaper` is on CRAN. Install the current version with:

```r
install.packages("rmapshaper")
```

You can install the development version from github with `remotes`:

```r
## install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("ateucher/rmapshaper")
```

### Usage

rmapshaper works with geojson strings (character objects of class `geo_json`) and `list` 
geojson objects of class `geo_list`. These classes are defined in the `geojsonio` 
package. It also works with `Spatial` classes from the `sp` package, and with `sf` and `scf` objects from the `sf` package.

We will use the `states` dataset from the `geojsonio` package and first turn it 
into a `geo_json` object:

```{r}
library(geojsonio)
library(rmapshaper)
library(sp)
library(sf)

## First convert to json
states_json <- geojson_json(states, geometry = "polygon", group = "group")

## For ease of illustration via plotting, we will convert to a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`:
states_sp <- geojson_sp(states_json)

## Plot the original
plot(states_sp)

## Now simplify using default parameters, then plot the simplified states
states_simp <- ms_simplify(states_sp)
plot(states_simp)
```

You can see that even at very high levels of simplification, the mapshaper
simplification algorithm preserves the topology, including shared boundaries:

```{r}
states_very_simp <- ms_simplify(states_sp, keep = 0.001)
plot(states_very_simp)
```

Compare this to the output using `rgeos::gSimplify`, where overlaps and gaps are evident:

```{r}
library(rgeos)
states_gsimp <- gSimplify(states_sp, tol = 1, topologyPreserve = TRUE)
plot(states_gsimp)
```

The package also works with `sf` objects. This time we'll demonstrate the `ms_innerlines` function:

```{r}
library(sf)

states_sf <- st_as_sf(states_sp)
states_sf_innerlines <- ms_innerlines(states_sf)
plot(states_sf_innerlines)

```


All of the functions are quite fast with `geo_json` character objects and `geo_list`
list objects. They are slower with the `Spatial` classes due to internal conversion 
to/from json. Operating on `sf` objects is faster than with `Spatial` objects, but not as fast as with the `geo_json` or `geo_list`. If you are going to do multiple operations on large `Spatial` objects, 
it's recommended to first convert to json using `geojson_list` or `geojson_json` from 
the `geojsonio` package. All of the functions have the input object as the first argument, 
and return the same class of object as the input. As such, they can be chained together. 
For a contrived example, using `states_sp` as created above:

```{r eval=rmapshaper:::check_v8_major_version() >= 6L}
library(geojsonio)
library(rmapshaper)
library(sp)
library(magrittr)

## First convert 'states' dataframe from geojsonio pkg to json
states_json <- geojson_json(states, lat = "lat", lon = "long", group = "group", 
                            geometry = "polygon")

states_json %>% 
  ms_erase(bbox = c(-107, 36, -101, 42)) %>% # Cut a big hole in the middle
  ms_dissolve() %>% # Dissolve state borders
  ms_simplify(keep_shapes = TRUE, explode = TRUE) %>% # Simplify polygon
  geojson_sp() %>% # Convert to SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
  plot(col = "blue") # plot
```

### Using the system mapshaper

Sometimes if you are dealing with a very large spatial object in R, `rmapshaper`
functions will take a very long time or not work at all. As of version `0.4.0`, 
you can make use of the system `mapshaper` library if you have it installed. 
This will allow you to work with very large spatial objects.

First make sure you have mapshaper installed:

```{r eval=nzchar(Sys.which("mapshaper"))}
check_sys_mapshaper()
```

If you get an error, you will need to install mapshaper. First install node 
(https://nodejs.org/en/) and then install mapshaper with:

```
npm install -g mapshaper
```

Then you can use the `sys` argument in any rmapshaper function:

```{r eval=nzchar(Sys.which("mapshaper"))}
states_simp_internal <- ms_simplify(states_sf)
states_simp_sys <- ms_simplify(states_sf, sys = TRUE, sys_mem=8) #sys_mem specifies the amout of memory to use in Gb.  It defaults to 8 if omitted. 

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(st_geometry(states_simp_internal), main = "internal")
plot(st_geometry(states_simp_sys), main = "system")
```


### Thanks

This package uses the [V8](https://cran.r-project.org/package=V8) package to provide an environment in which to run mapshaper's javascript code in R. It relies heavily on all of the great spatial packages that already exist (especially `sp` and `rgdal`), the `geojsonio` package for converting between `geo_list`, `geo_json`, and `sf` and `Spatial` objects, and the `jsonlite` package for converting between json strings and R objects. 

Thanks to [timelyportfolio](https://github.com/timelyportfolio) for helping me wrangle the javascript to the point where it works in V8. He also wrote the [mapshaper htmlwidget](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/mapshaper_htmlwidget), which provides access to the mapshaper web interface, right in your R session. We have plans to combine the two in the future.
