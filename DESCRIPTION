Description: Edit and simplify 'geojson', 'Spatial', and 'sf'
    objects.  This is wrapper around the 'mapshaper' 'JavaScript' library
    by Matthew Bloch <https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/> to perform
    topologically-aware polygon simplification, as well as other
    operations such as clipping, erasing, dissolving, and converting
    'multi-part' to 'single-part' geometries.
