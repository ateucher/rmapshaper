Description: Edit and simplify 'geojson', 'Spatial', and 'sf'
    objects.  This is wrapper around the 'mapshaper' 'JavaScript' library
    by Matthew Bloch <https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/> to perform
    topologically-aware polygon simplification, as well as other
    operations such as clipping, erasing, dissolving, and converting
    'multi-part' to 'single-part' geometries.  It relies on the
    'geojsonio' package for working with 'geojson' objects, the 'sf'
    package for working with 'sf' objects, and the 'sp' and 'rgdal'
    packages for working with 'Spatial' objects.
