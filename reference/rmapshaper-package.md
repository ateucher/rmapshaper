# rmapshaper: Client for 'mapshaper' for 'Geospatial' Operations

Edit and simplify 'geojson', 'Spatial', and 'sf' objects. This is
wrapper around the 'mapshaper' 'JavaScript' library by Matthew Bloch
<https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/> to perform topologically-aware
polygon simplification, as well as other operations such as clipping,
erasing, dissolving, and converting 'multi-part' to 'single-part'
geometries.
